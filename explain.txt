COmponents of redux toolkit

// Store

This is where you create the place where you store all of yopur state

// Slicers

This is basically the interface that explains each type of state that you want.
i.e some state for wallets, some state for users, some state for weather data

interface WalletState  {

id: int,
name: string
}

interface UserState {

name: string,
age: int

}

// Actions

This is where you define the actions. Becareful, is not the action itself, just its identifiers
THe action itself is happening later in the reducers

const increase = {type: "INCREASE", payload: 1}
const decrease = {type: "DECREASE", payload: 1}

==> always capital name in the type and always string

// Reducers
This is where we define how the state is changed and affected based on the actions.

Redux Toolkit

IMportant: We have to create a ReduxProvider, and wrap all the children components by wrapping the {children} inside Layout.tsx file in APp folder

IMPORTANT: We use useSelector hook to access the state in our React component file, then create our Handler functions that get the data and execute useDispatch() to trigger the reducers functionality.

Then we pass those handlers in the onClick actions of react components.

Remember to use use client whenever needed. Basically every router you create (aka the folders within the app directory) will have a page.tsx file, in there you put on top "use client" so you can use the redux stuff.
